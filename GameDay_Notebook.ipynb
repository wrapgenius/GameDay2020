    "# GameDay2020 Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard dilemma of fantasy baseball is who to choose next: the best available player but in a position you've already filled?; the best at a rare position?; the next best closer because they're going fast?  Whatever choice you make will have consequences, as the next player will no longer have your pick as a choice, and so on.  Ideally you would forecast how each of those would play out and take the best option --- that's exactly what this code does: it identifies the best player left in each of the positions you still need to fill, simulates the rest of draft in each of those scenarios, and returns the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it's easy to use!  After [cloning](https://github.com/wrapgenius/GameDay2020) GameDay2020 (and provided you have Jupyter Notebooks with Python 3 installed, and a spreadsheet program) you should have everything you need to do a live roto draft.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is based on three ingredients: *projections*, *rankings*, and *injuries*:  \n",
    "- Projections are estimates of player performances for 2020, and are based on data scraped from [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/projections.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&type=zips) (model = ZiPS, Steamer, or TheBat.) \n",
    "- Rankings are draft-order recommendations.  The default (i.e.; ranking_method = 'Yahoo') is to use Yahoo Rankings (from Feb 22, 2020).  Others include [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/fantasy/baseball/story/_/id/28285423/fantasy-baseball-2020-rankings-roto-rotisserie), [FantasyPros](https://www.fantasypros.com/mlb/rankings/overall.php), and [Rotographs](https://fantasy.fangraphs.com), or you can put in your own.  Yahoo for yahoo leagues makes most sense since it most closely imitates autodraft.    \n",
    "- Injured players to be removed from draft consideration are located in the Injuries2020.xlsx file found in the Injured_List_Spreadsheets directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Your_ roto league may have more or less than 12 teams, or use different stats; that ok!  Declare them when defining the Draft object: most of the obvious stats are included, more obscure ones may require hacking into the [fangraphs_projection_2020](https://github.com/wrapgenius/GameDay2020/blob/master/GameDayFunctions/fangraphs_projection_2020.py).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, if you choose to shuffle_picks = True, it will not default to the next best pick, but draw a random number between 0 and 1 and compare it to the sigmoid function 1/1+exp(-(pick_number - avg_pick_number)).  So say it's the 15th pick and Trevor Story, who is typically drafted 10th is available, there is an 85% chance you'll select him.  Also note, it can't _yet_ do AL or NL only. \n",
